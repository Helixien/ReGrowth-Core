	/// A fast random number generator for .NET
	/// Colin Green, January 2005
	/// 
	/// September 4th 2005
	///	 Added NextBytesUnsafe() - commented out by default.
	///	 Fixed bug in Reinitialise() - y,z and w variables were not being reset.
	/// 
	/// Key points:
	///  1) Based on a simple and fast xor-shift pseudo random number generator (RNG) specified in: 
	///  Marsaglia, George. (2003). Xorshift RNGs.
	///  http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/xorshift.pdf
	///  
	///  This particular implementation of xorshift has a period of 2^128-1. See the above paper to see
	///  how this can be easily extened if you need a longer period. At the time of writing I could find no 
	///  information on the period of System.Random for comparison.
	/// 
	///  2) Faster than System.Random. Up to 8x faster, depending on which methods are called.
	/// 
	///  3) Direct replacement for System.Random. This class implements all of the methods that System.Random 
	///  does plus some additional methods. The like named methods are functionally equivalent.
	///  
	///  4) Allows fast re-initialisation with a seed, unlike System.Random which accepts a seed at construction
	///  time which then executes a relatively expensive initialisation routine. This provides a vast speed improvement
	///  if you need to reset the pseudo-random number sequence many times, e.g. if you want to re-generate the same
	///  sequence many times. An alternative might be to cache random numbers in an array, but that approach is limited
	///  by memory capacity and the fact that you may also want a large number of different sequences cached. Each sequence
	///  can each be represented by a single seed value (int) when using FastRandom.
	///  
	///  Notes.
	///  A further performance improvement can be obtained by declaring local variables as static, thus avoiding 
	///  re-allocation of variables on each call. However care should be taken if multiple instances of
	///  FastRandom are in use or if being used in a multi-threaded environment.
	///
