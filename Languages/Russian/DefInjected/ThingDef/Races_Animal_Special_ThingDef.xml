  <!--                       Engineered for neutroamine production, the neutrolope grows a large sac of pure neutroamine on its back. Though it is weak and fragile for its size, other animals avoid it similarly to a boomalope, despite the fact it does not explode when it dies. It can be milked to produce neutroamine. -->
