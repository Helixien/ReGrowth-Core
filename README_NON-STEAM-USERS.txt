Important!

If you have RimWorld from another platform (GOG, DRM-Free over the Website, EPIC) and need to download mods from other sources, or you made a RimPy local copy, make sure the folder name of this mod is exactly "ReGrowth-Core" or "ReGrowth2-Core", depending on the version you use. 

If the name differs, the game can not find the grass textures in the asset bundle, and you will get errors. The asset bundles are needed to make grass look correctly, or rather not have visual artifacts. For that, grass needs to be in the .psd format (Photoshop). There is no other way around it, due to an engine limitation it can't be done with .pngs or .dds files.
